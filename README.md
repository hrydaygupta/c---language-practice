# C Language Practice

# 💻 C Programming Practice – Foundation Complete 🔥

This repository contains a structured collection of C programs written and practiced as part of my foundational programming journey. These exercises helped solidify my understanding of core logic, memory management, arrays, pointers, strings, structures, and functions in C.

## 📂 What’s Inside

- **📊 Number-based Programs:** Palindrome, Armstrong, Factorial, etc.
- **📈 Series Programs:** Fibonacci, Sum of N terms, Prime numbers, etc.
- **🧮 Array Challenges:** Sum, average, max/min, row/column operations
- **🧠 Switch-case Utilities:** Multi-case logic bundles (sum, reverse, even check, etc.)
- **📦 Structures & Pointers:** Realistic structure-based data handling
- **🧵 String Operations:** Length, copy, concat, tokenization, comparisons

All code is clean, functional, and tested — designed for revision and interviews.
